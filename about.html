          <h1>Hi, here's a little bit about myself.</h1>
          <h2>My interest in Computers</h2>
          <p>
             I can't really pinpoint exactly when I became interested in computers, my best guess is it probably had something to do with
             the business my mother started and eventually sold when I was younger. The business was called "Bayside Learning Centre" and it was in an old building
             in the middle of the Redlands. She had a lab with twenty or so computers that she used to teach clients how to use computers and
             the various programs installed on them (Microsoft Office Suite, Browsers, File explorer, etc), it was the perfect environment
             for me to experiment and gain some experience very early on. Ultimately, it gave me an opportunity to start using computers
             for purposes other than playing games, and I think that's where my interest in computers began.
          </p>
          <h2>My academic journey</h2>
          <p>
            Due to unfortunate circumstances I was not able to complete my final year in highschool, and thus didn't meet the entry requirements to gain entry to the University of my choice. 
            Thankfully I am incredibly persistent and didn't let that stop me from achieving my goals. So I enrolled into the Diploma of Information Technology at
            Griffith College and eventually graduated with a handful of academic excelence awards.
          </p>
          <p>
            After receiving my Diploma I followed the route of most Griffith College students and used the Diploma to gain entry to the Bachelor of Information Technology 
            at Griffith University. I have completed two trimesters so far and I can proudly say I'm maintaining a GPA of 7.
          </p>
          <p>
           During the first trimester of 2020 I came to the realisation that I'm far more interested in Computer Science than IT, and I felt like the content at Griffith University was not enough of a challenge.
           So I decided I was going to challenge myself by applying to the University of Queensland's Bachelor of Computer Science, I've heard that it is the best computer science degree
           in Queensland and I want to gain the most insightful and applicable education possible. I received an offer and will be starting in semester 2 2020.
          </p>
          <h2>Where I am today</h2>
          <p>
            Currently I am doing as much self-study as I can in order to be a highly competitive candidate for employment. I have just completed a 13 week course on Python,
            and I'm now learning C and C++. I created this website in order to highlight my ability to learn new technologies, the last time I learnt any web development was in 2017
            so this was a bit of a refresher for me, I really enjoyed putting this together.         
          </p>
          <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
